This is my realization of the task:

"Implement console application(mandatory)
  -  Read txt file and split it by lines
  -  Calculate statistic for each line: longest word(symbols between 2 spaces), shortest word, line length, average word length. Unit test are mandatory
  -  Aggregate these values for all lines from file(unit test)
  -  Store line and file statistic into DB(with JDBC)."

I used MySQL Workbench to create data base and table "statistic", in which I write data from the program. Table "statistic" looks like that:
